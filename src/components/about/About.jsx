                        Boys Volleyball is a club sport in Westerville School District.  Over the past decade, our program provide
                        student-athletes with the opportunity to excel in teamwork, sportsmanship, self-discipline, and moral character.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        Our program is about students first.  We want student-athletes to learn to balance priorities by allowing them to 
                        be multi-sport athletes and participating in other extra-curricular activities.  We strive to enrich and support 
                        student-athletes by empowering players to collectively build an energetic, healthy, and competitive team environment.
